A·FLOWER·WEDDING


    Yes, flower bells rang right merry that day,
    When there was a marriage of flowers, they say.

[Illustration]


    Young LAD’S LOVE had courted Miss Meadow·Sweet,
    And the two soon agreed at the Altar to meet.

[Illustration]


    A LILY white robe was worn by the Bride,
    And SWEET WILLIAM, the Groom, drest in red, at her side.

[Illustration]

    Miss VIOLET, PRIMROSE, and gay MARYGOLD,
    With their LADIES’ FINGERS her train did uphold.

[Illustration]

    In LADYSMOCKS, Bridesmaids, FORGET·ME·NOT blue,
    With their sashes all tied in LOVE·KNOT·TRUE.

[Illustration]

    The Bride’s Mother follows with loving EYEBRIGHT,
    All in WINTER GREEN and fine FURZE bedight.

[Illustration]


    Whilst her father looked young, though with OLD·MAN’S·BEARD.

[Illustration]

    (Was a DANDE·LION in youth I have heard.)

[Illustration]


    The troth was plighted for woe or for weal,
    And the lines attested by SOLOMON’S SEAL:

[Illustration]

    The BACHELOR’S BUTTON was cast aside,

[Illustration]

    And the throng that witnessed was LONDON’S PRIDE:

[Illustration]

    There was GOOD KING HENRY, a tall JONQUIL,

[Illustration]

    Like NARCISSUS himself by the waters still;

[Illustration]

    There were LORDS & LADIES to grace the dance,

[Illustration]

    And ROSE MARY, and—

[Illustration]

                        ROSE·LA·FRANCE:

[Illustration]

    With his GOLDEN ROD

[Illustration]

                          the SWEET SULTAN came;

[Illustration]

    Lastly, CREEPING JENNY, an elderly dame

[Illustration]

    To order the feast—there was LING, and HARTSTONGUE,

[Illustration]

    And GOOSEFOOT with SAGE, the HOUSE·LEEK among

[Illustration]

    Very SWEET PEAS, & GOOD CHERRY PIE,
    Such a feast as an Alderman could not deny!

[Illustration]

    In lovely KING·CUPS there was CHAMOMILE TEA

[Illustration]

    And the fortune in gifts was a wonder to see!
    A new PENNY-ROYAL, A fine GOLDEN FEATHER;

[Illustration]

    A pair of HORSE-CHESTNUTS,

[Illustration]

                                  a JACOB’S LADDER,

[Illustration]

    VENUS’S·LOOKING·GLASS,

[Illustration]

                            a fine ARROW-HEAD
    Discovered long since in the river’s bed;

[Illustration]

    Garments of FLAX,

[Illustration]

                        and a LADY’S CUSHION;

[Illustration]

    HOSE·IN·HOSE, LADY’S SLIPPERS to put on,

[Illustration]

    BUTTERCUPS gold, and a PITCHER-PLANT
    Nay, everything that a house could want.

[Illustration]

    In VENUS’S-FLY-TRAP the pair drove away,

[Illustration]

    “SPEEDWELL, and be happy,” their friends gaily say;

[Illustration]

    But alack! what a hubbub when one chanced to find
    The Bride’s only BOX was there left behind!

[Illustration]

    The WILD-THYME they had, and the fuss that was made
    Kept the guests in a rout thro’ the DEADLY NIGHT SHADE.

[Illustration]

    But the CLOCKS ticked apace to the ope of DAIS-Y
    SNOWFLAKES were fast falling when all said good-bye,

[Illustration]

    With regrets for “that box,”—yet they need not to stint,
    For the Bridegroom was rich, he’d a post at the MINT
